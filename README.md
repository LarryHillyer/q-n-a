q-n-a - Questions and answers with Angularjs
============================================

Step 1: The requirements
------------------------

> Good Questions are hard to come by.... and their answers even more so. As your client I am requesting you to build me an application that will be the next best thing since sliced bread. 

###My Application will need the following features.
1. A place for users to post questions.
2. Each question should be able to have its own list of responses and comments. 
3. Each Response can have its own list of questions.
4. Responses can be marked as solutions.
5. Questions, Responses, and comments can be upvoted or downvoted and should be ordered according to the most votes.
6. Questions should also be sortable by date.
7. Questions should be able to have topic tags attached to help with searching.
8. A search bar should be availble and will filter the questions based upon the query.


Getting Started
---------------

> Before diving straight into the code. Plan out each feature. Think about the controllers and views that you will need to accomplish each of these tasks. 

- Put together an Angular App and make sure you can get {{2+2}} to print out 4.
- Then add your first controller and make sure you can get a $scope.test to show up at the view.
- Focus on each feature one at a time... 
  - Remember that one of the benefits of using angular is having individual components that all work together.
